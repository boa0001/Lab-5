Reflect on how you currently manage your documents and code, particularly content associated with publishable work. Would it stand up to a reproducibility test? How do you think non-reproducibile research affects computational biology and bioinformatics? What about in your specific field of study?

For the most part the documents associated with publication work are named differently without following a pattern. This poses problems with reproducibility as an updated file can be confused from a prior version. Currently we do not have any experience of working with manuscripts that use code. The correct approach would be, with the knowledge we have from the current course, to use commit statements to have the file updated as we progress in our work.
Our current method of updating manuscripts would not stand up to a reproducibility test.
With the non-reproducible research approaches currently practiced limits the credibility of certain papers while at the same time making it harder to peer-review. This is because independent researchers would find it difficult to replicate your findings and thus complicated the advancement of science.
With our field of study, dealing with molecular approaches, it demands updated versions of genomes/transcriptomes to be readily available for public access. If there is a lack of updated data available, it causes problems with downstream research applications.
