Reflect on how you currently manage your documents and code, particularly content associated with publishable work. Would it stand up to a reproducibility test? How do you think non-reproducible research affects computational biology and bioinformatics? What about in your specific field of study?


Currently managing files is the basic process that is very normal but working with the manuscripts is difficult as I don't have experience in working with them with codes,but using the class study from this course I think I will be able to go ahead and make myself accustomed to the easier approach to manuscript.
The current mode of approach is not a reproducible test.Unlike the reproducible test we don't really have much access to the data it limits the progress in the non-reproducibility test thus making it difficult for anyone on the research team to access the data.

In the field of study I am in, the data to process and work with are really large, so the data is processed with the experiments and maybe published only when the data is completely processed.
