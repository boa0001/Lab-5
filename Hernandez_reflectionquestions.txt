Reflect on how you currently manage your documents and code, particularly content associated with publishable work. Would it stand up to a reproducibility test? How do you think non-reproducibile research affects computational biology and bioinformatics? What about in your specific field of study?

In my case, i do not have particular syntax for my publication documents. I rely on putting random names and looking at the last time they were modified that way i know which one was techncically the last edit. This can definitiely cause problems with reproducibility as other users would not be able to see the changes I made from within my local drive since they would not have access to it. Although i have no experience working with code SOP/manuscripts I havent had that problem, but going forward with my PhD i intend to use commit statements to have the file updated as I progress in the coding script. This method of updating manuscripts should then stand up to a reproducibility test. With the non-reproducible research approaches currently practiced, this limits the credibility of certain papers while at the same time making it harder to peer-review. This is because independent researchers would find it difficult to replicate your findings and thus complicated the advancement of science.
With our field of study, dealing with molecular approaches, it demands updated versions of genomes/transcriptomes to be readily available for public access. Additionaly, a lot of experiments/studies build upon one another and therefore if there is a  lack of reproductibility you are just making it more complex for other scientist to advacne work you have done.
